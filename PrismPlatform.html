                <h3>About</h3>
                
                <p>Prism Platform is a puzzle platform where you can change the color of the world
                    using 'Q' and 'E' to reveal hidden elements and solve puzzles and reach the end 
                    of the level. (31:10)</p>

                <h3>Post Production</h3>
                <p>Honestly, I feel like Prism Platform could've had a diffrent feel that having
                sprites takes from. I personally would've had it simple, subtle and minimalistic 
                feel with not a lot of colors except the ones that a lens is changed to. I 
                perfered the capsule model, simple and stands out in a color-changing world.</p>
                
                <p>Honestly, I also wished I sounded better and didn't stutter in the stream.
                There was a lot of hiccups on our team's section of it as well I wish could've 
                been avoided.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose I would also say I wish we changed the white titles to change colors as 
                when the world changed as well. We did it witgh the background, could've did it with the
                titles as well.</p>
