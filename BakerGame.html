                <h3>About</h3>
                
                <p>This was an combonation of assignments that had us working with player controls, having more than one player, 
                spawning objects, UI fuctions, Fuctions based on builds, and translating contols depending on the controller. </p>
        
                <h3>Work Done</h3>
                <p>Following my professor's lecture (Shout outs to Walek)</p>
                
                <h3>Anything I'd Change</h3>
                <p>Being able to finish the tank part of this, honestly. Maybe also having my UI match the camera?
                I don't know, Itch's cropping is weird. I think I could possibly see if I could upgrade the version as well, 
                add more of the assignments onto the collection, or I may get rid of this page/put another project up here.</p>
                
                <p> I honestly have this up just to have something for my assignment, not gonna lie.</p>
